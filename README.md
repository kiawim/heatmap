# heatmap
Machine learning algorithm that learns to generate a map of urban heat islands from an input satellite image. \n
Project2.py contains a Pyhton code that learns to associate a satellite image with its heatmap. This is done with a K Nearest Neighbours classifier, imported from the scikitlearn library. \n
After this learning stage, the trained model is able to predict the location of heat islands from a satellite image.
